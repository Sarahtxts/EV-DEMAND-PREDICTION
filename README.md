# EV-DEMAND-PREDICTION

This repository contains a project for forecasting the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) using historical data and machine learning models.

---

## Repository Contents

- **EV_dataset.csv**: Dataset containing historical EV demand data.
- **ev.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and forecasting steps.
- **forecasting_ev_model.pkl**: Trained machine learning model saved as a pickle file.

## Project Overview

The project aims to predict the demand for electric vehicles by analyzing past demand data and employing forecasting techniques. The provided notebook (`ev.ipynb`) demonstrates the complete workflow starting from loading the dataset, exploring and preprocessing the data, building a forecasting model, and saving the trained model for future predictions.
